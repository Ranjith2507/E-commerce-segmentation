# E-commerce-segmentation
Problem Statement:

As an e-commerce platform, it is very important to profile your customers, dividing your clientele base into groups based on their needs and expectations.
In this project, we are interested in analyzing the content of an E-commerce database that lists purchases made by âˆ¼4000 customers over a period of one year (1/12/2010 to 9/12/2011).
Based on this analysis, we would like to develop models to group the 4000 customers into different buckets. Such a model must take into account the similarity between the products purchased between the users

Minimum Requirements:
The end objective of the participant is to come up with customer segmentations that take into account all the information that is presented in the dataset. The participant is expected to use NLP techniques to find similarity between the products.
